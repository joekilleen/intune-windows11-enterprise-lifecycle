## License Intent (Non-Binding Clarification)

This license applies to **documentation and architectural reference material only**.

It does **not**:

* Grant access to Microsoft services, tenants, or subscriptions
* Transfer responsibility for security, compliance, or operations
* Replace the need for professional judgment or legal review

Organizations adopting patterns from this repository do so **at their own risk** and must validate suitability within their own regulatory and operational context.
