# Procurement Negotiation Script  
**Windows 11 Enterprise Device Lifecycle (Microsoft Intune)**

---

## Purpose

This document provides **ready-to-use negotiation language** for procurement, legal, and vendor management discussions related to the Windows 11 Enterprise Device Lifecycle engagement.

Its goals are to:
- Defend fixed-fee pricing
- Protect scope and delivery boundaries
- Reduce unplanned concessions
- Maintain a professional, collaborative tone
- Close deals without eroding margin or quality

This is a **playbook**, not a policy.

---

## Negotiation Posture

**Tone:** Calm, professional, confident  
**Positioning:** Risk reduction, not labor hours  
**Anchor:** Outcomes, evidence, and accountability  

Key principle:
> “We price outcomes and accountability, not time.”

---

## Opening Position (Set the Frame)

**Use when procurement first challenges price or scope**

> “This engagement is priced as a fixed-fee delivery for defined outcomes.  
> The pricing reflects senior architectural responsibility, audit-ready documentation, and risk ownership—not task-level effort.”

Pause. Do not over-explain.

---

## Common Procurement Objections & Responses

### 1. “Can you lower the price?”

**Response (Primary):**

> “We’re already delivering this at a fixed fee with clearly defined scope and acceptance criteria.  
> Reducing price would require removing deliverables or reducing coverage, which increases operational or audit risk.”

**Follow-up (If pushed):**

> “If budget is constrained, we can discuss de-scoping specific workstreams through a formal change—but we don’t discount without changing outcomes.”

---

### 2. “Other vendors are cheaper.”

**Response:**

> “That’s expected if they’re quoting task execution or time-based delivery.  
> This engagement includes architecture ownership, audit defensibility, and documented runbooks that most vendors exclude.”

**Optional closer:**

> “The cost difference usually appears later as remediation, rework, or audit findings.”

---

### 3. “Can you include ongoing support?”

**Response:**

> “Ongoing support is intentionally excluded to keep this engagement focused and fixed-fee.  
> If you want managed services, we can price that separately under a different SOW.”

Do not bundle managed services for free.

---

### 4. “Can we treat this as time & materials?”

**Response:**

> “We intentionally structured this as fixed-fee to protect both parties.  
> T&M shifts delivery risk back to the client and removes cost predictability.”

**Optional:**

> “If you prefer T&M, we’d need to re-scope and reprice the engagement entirely.”

---

### 5. “Can you guarantee compliance or no security incidents?”

**Response:**

> “No responsible provider guarantees outcomes outside their control.  
> What we guarantee is enforceable controls, documented processes, and evidence that withstands audits.”

This builds credibility.

---

### 6. “Can we skip the pilot or non-production phase?”

**Response:**

> “Skipping the pilot increases outage and audit risk.  
> We won’t recommend removing risk controls that protect production.”

**If pressured:**

> “We can document that decision as a client-directed risk acceptance, but we won’t silently remove safeguards.”

---

### 7. “Can you throw in additional apps or tenants?”

**Response:**

> “The current pricing includes defined limits.  
> Additional apps or tenants materially increase scope and must go through change control.”

Always redirect to the change process.

---

## Discount Strategy (If Required)

### Acceptable Concessions (Ranked)

1. **Payment terms acceleration** (preferred)
2. **Reduced documentation depth (non-core)**  
3. **Phased delivery deferral**

### Unacceptable Concessions

- Free scope expansion
- Unlimited applications
- Multiple tenants without repricing
- Ongoing support included “temporarily”
- Removal of acceptance criteria

---

## Anchoring Language for Executives

Use this when procurement escalates to leadership:

> “This engagement reduces security, audit, and operational risk across the entire endpoint lifecycle.  
> The cost of a single incident or failed audit typically exceeds the project fee.”

Keep it factual. Avoid fear-mongering.

---

## When to Walk Away

Consider disengaging if the client insists on:

- No documented scope
- No acceptance criteria
- Unlimited changes without repricing
- Verbal-only commitments
- Outcome guarantees without authority control

Walking away protects your reputation and margin.

---

## Closing Language

**Use when terms are aligned:**

> “If the scope, assumptions, and pricing align, we’re ready to proceed immediately under the agreed SOW.”

Then stop talking.

---

## Internal Notes (Provider-Only)

- Never negotiate alone on material concessions
- Always document changes
- Silence is a negotiation tool
- Procurement pressure increases near quarter-end
- Confidence signals maturity

---

## Summary

This negotiation script helps you:

- Maintain pricing discipline
- Protect delivery quality
- Avoid scope creep
- Close deals professionally
- Preserve long-term credibility

Strong boundaries build trust.
