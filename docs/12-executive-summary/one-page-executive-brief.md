# One-Page Executive Brief  
**Windows 11 Enterprise Device Lifecycle (Intune)**

---

## Executive Summary

This initiative establishes a **secure, auditable, and scalable Windows 11 device lifecycle** using Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Entra ID.

The architecture ensures that:
- Only **trusted, compliant devices** access corporate resources
- Endpoint risk is **actively managed**, not assumed
- Operational changes are **predictable and reversible**
- Audits can be satisfied **quickly and confidently**

This is a **business risk control program**, not just an IT deployment.

---

## The Business Problem

Most endpoint environments fail due to:
- Inconsistent device configuration
- Excessive administrative privilege
- Uncontrolled updates and application changes
- Weak offboarding and device retirement
- Poor audit evidence and documentation

These gaps result in:
- Increased breach likelihood
- Operational outages
- Audit findings and remediation cost
- Executive uncertainty around endpoint risk

---

## The Solution

A **governed end-to-end device lifecycle**, covering:

1. **Provisioning** – Secure enrollment with Windows Autopilot  
2. **Security Baseline** – Encryption, EDR, firewall, hardening  
3. **Compliance & Access** – Device health gates identity access  
4. **Applications** – Standardized, version-controlled deployment  
5. **Updates** – Ring-based servicing with enforced deadlines  
6. **Monitoring** – Continuous security and stability visibility  
7. **Incident Response** – Rapid containment and rebuild  
8. **Lifecycle Operations** – Reset, reassignment, decommissioning  
9. **Governance** – Least privilege, access reviews, audit evidence  

Each stage is documented, owned, tested, and evidenced.

## Risk Reduction Achieved

| Risk Area | Outcome |
---|---|
| Endpoint compromise | Rapid isolation and rebuild |
| Privilege abuse | RBAC + just-in-time access |
| Configuration drift | Enforced baselines |
| Update outages | Pilot validation + rollback |
| Data leakage | Encryption + cryptographic wipe |
| Audit failure | Mapped, retained evidence |

Risk is **explicitly managed and visible** to leadership.

---

## Compliance Alignment

The program aligns to recognized frameworks:
- **CIS Controls v8**
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5**
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**

Compliance is achieved through **technical enforcement plus documented process**, not policy alone.

---

## Operating Model

Clear separation of duties:
- **Security** – Trust, access, and incident authority  
- **Endpoint Engineering** – Configuration, apps, updates  
- **Operations** – Day-to-day lifecycle actions  
- **GRC / Audit** – Oversight and evidence  
- **Leadership** – Risk acceptance  

No single team has unchecked control.

---

## Executive Metrics

Leadership tracks outcomes, not tools:
- % of compliant devices
- Update deadline adherence
- Incident containment time
- Endpoint stability trends
- Access exceptions
- Audit response time

All metrics are **evidence-backed**.

---

## Why This Matters

This architecture enables the organization to:
- Scale securely without proportional headcount growth
- Absorb acquisitions without inheriting hidden risk
- Survive incidents without improvisation
- Pass audits without disruption
- Give executives confidence in endpoint security posture

---

## Bottom Line

This Windows 11 Intune Enterprise Device Lifecycle is:

- **Security-first**
- **Operationally mature**
- **Audit-ready**
- **Executive-defensible**

It functions as an **operating system for endpoint trust**.
