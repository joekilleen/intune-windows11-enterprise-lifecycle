# Feature Request

## Summary

Provide a clear, high-level description of the requested feature.

- What capability is being requested?
- What problem does it solve?
- Who benefits?

This section should be understandable to non-technical stakeholders.

---

## Business Justification

Describe the **business or operational driver** for this request.

| Driver | Description |
---|---|
| Business objective | |
| Risk reduction | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| Compliance requirement | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| User productivity | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| Cost optimization | ☐ Yes ☐ No |

Feature requests without business justification may be rejected.

---

## Requested Capability

Describe the feature in more detail.

- New functionality or enhancement
- Expected behavior
- Success criteria

Avoid implementation specifics unless necessary.

---

## Scope Assessment (Proposed)

Indicate which areas are impacted.

| Area | Impact |
---|---|
| Enrollment / Autopilot | ☐ None ☐ Minor ☐ Major |
| Security Baselines | ☐ None ☐ Minor ☐ Major |
| Compliance / CA | ☐ None ☐ Minor ☐ Major |
| Applications | ☐ None ☐ Minor ☐ Major |
| Updates / Servicing | ☐ None ☐ Minor ☐ Major |
| Operations / Runbooks | ☐ None ☐ Minor ☐ Major |
| Governance / RBAC | ☐ None ☐ Minor ☐ Major |

---

## Non-Goals

Explicitly state what this feature **will not** do.

This prevents scope creep and misalignment.

---

## Impact and Risk Considerations

| Area | Assessment |
---|---|
| Security impact | ☐ None ☐ Low ☐ Medium ☐ High |
| Compliance impact | ☐ None ☐ Low ☐ Medium ☐ High |
| Operational complexity | ☐ None ☐ Low ☐ Medium ☐ High |
| User experience impact | ☐ Positive ☐ Neutral ☐ Negative |

If risk is Medium or High, additional review is required.

---

## Dependencies and Constraints

Identify known dependencies or blockers.

- Licensing requirements
- Microsoft platform limitations
- Third-party integrations
- Timeline dependencies
- Organizational constraints

---

## Alternatives Considered

List any alternatives evaluated.

| Alternative | Reason Not Selected |
---|---|

If no alternatives were considered, state why.

---

## Success Metrics

Define how success will be measured.

- Adoption rate
- Reduction in incidents
- Compliance improvement
- Performance metrics
- Audit outcomes

Undefined success metrics weaken prioritization.

---

## Implementation Notes (Optional)

Optional technical notes for Engineering review.

- Proposed approach
- Known design patterns
- Reference documentation

This section is **non-binding**.

---

## Change Control and Governance

Check all that apply:

- ☐ Requires architecture review
- ☐ Requires security review
- ☐ Requires compliance review
- ☐ Requires change request approval
- ☐ Requires pilot / non-production validation

Features will not bypass governance.
