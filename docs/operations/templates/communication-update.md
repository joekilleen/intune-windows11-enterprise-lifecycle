# Communication Update Template  
**Incident, Outage, and Security Event Communications**

---

## Purpose

This template standardizes **timely, accurate, and controlled communications** during operational incidents, outages, and security events.

Its objectives are to:
- Ensure consistent messaging across audiences
- Prevent speculation and misinformation
- Protect legal and security boundaries
- Maintain trust with users and leadership
- Provide audit-ready communication records

This template supports **updates**, not root cause explanations.

## Communication Principles

- Be factual and concise
- Avoid speculation or blame
- Do not disclose sensitive security details

- Maintain a predictable cadence
- Say what is known, what is not, and when the next update will occur
